I am Victor Ukpongette

In this project, I have been made to review everything about python, in readiness for the big AirBnB project coming up.

The objectives of this project is to make me to know:

What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
How to serialize and deserialize a Class
How to write and read a JSON file
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function

----------------------In my own words-------------------------------------

In Python programming, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (known as a subclass or derived class) that is based on an existing class (known as a base class or parent class). Inheritance enables you to reuse the attributes and methods of the base class in the derived class, promoting code reusability and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.

The key idea behind inheritance is that the subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors (methods) of the base class, and it can also add its own attributes and methods or override the inherited methods to customize their behavior.

Main Objectives of this project is to enable me understand 

Why Python programming is awesome
What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
What is a subclass
How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
When can an instance have new attributes
How to inherit class from another
How to define a class with multiple base classes
What is the default class every class inherit from
How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
What is the purpose of inheritance
What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions
